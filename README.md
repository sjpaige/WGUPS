# Class Project: Package Delivery Routing

## Project Purpose
The goal of this class project was to create a lightweight package delivery simulation. It required only a text based 
user interface to demonstrate specific outcomes. The delivery algorithm should optimize the packing of the trucks, and 
the delivery route to minimize the distance travelled. 

## Interface
A very basic command interface, it has a set of commands based on selecting numbers 0 to 5 and hitting return.

## Learning Outcomes

* Learned to create hashtable data structure from scratch.
* Created a somewhat efficient routing algorithm.
* Worked to calculated program and algorithm efficiency.
